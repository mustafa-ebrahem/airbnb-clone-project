# 🏠 airbnb-clone-project

## 📝 Brief Overview

This project as the name suggests, will be a clone of the infamous airbnb, but it is backend oriented, this is part of the ProDev Backend Software engineering program. I will be using Django, Javascript and PostgreSQL as the main tech stack, there will be some more like Graphql, Redis, Celery, Docker and CI/CD Pipelines.


## 👥 Team Roles

### for team roles, currently its just me, but even for a solo developer i have to take different roles at the same time, the following roles is the perfect scenario and not reality

#this will be role : responsibility/mainly do
- **Business analyst** (BA) : Meets with the stakeholders/customers/users as they are the middle ground between them and the developers and the upper management.

- **Project manager (PM)** : Manages the development team and is responsible to meet deadlines.

- **UI/UX designer** : Creates the initial design according to the specifications of the customer until approval.

- **Software architect** : Designs the High-level architecture of the system and decides on the tools to be used but mostly the team uses the tools they are best at.

- **Software developer/Engineer** : Develops the code according to the UI/UX and the architecture may do unit tests

- **Quality assurance (QA) engineer** : Makes sure an application performs according to requirements, may do manual and automated tests.

this may vary depending on company size, culture and available personnal

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management
User registration, authentication, and profile management system. This feature enables secure account creation, login functionality, and allows users to maintain their profiles with personal information and preferences.

### 🏘️ Property Management
CRUD operations for property listings including details like location, pricing, and availability. This system allows hosts to create and manage their property listings with descriptions, images, amenities, and house rules.

### 📅 Booking System
Calendar-based reservation system with availability tracking and booking confirmation. This feature handles the complete booking process from searching available dates to confirming reservations, and manages the communications between guests and hosts.

### 💰 Payment Processing
Secure payment handling for bookings with transaction history. This system processes and records payments between guests and hosts while maintaining payment records and handling refunds when necessary.

### ⭐ Review System
Rating and feedback mechanism for properties and hosts. This feature allows guests to share their experiences through ratings and comments, helping future guests make informed decisions and hosts improve their offerings.

### 🔍 Search & Filtering
Advanced search capabilities with multiple filters for finding properties. This system enables users to find suitable accommodations based on location, price range, amenities, dates, and other criteria to enhance the user experience.

### 📣 Notification System
Automated alerts for booking confirmations, messages, and other important events. This feature keeps users informed about their bookings, messages from other users, and important updates through email or in-app notifications.

## 🔒 API Security

### Key Security Measures

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication system to verify user identity
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for guests, hosts, and administrators
- **OAuth 2.0**: Support for third-party authentication providers for secure and convenient login

#### 🛡️ Data Protection
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Encrypted connections for all API communications
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive information like passwords and payment details stored with strong encryption
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

#### 🚦 Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Account Lockout Policies**: Temporary lockout after multiple failed authentication attempts
- **API Usage Quotas**: Limiting requests per user to ensure fair usage and system stability

### Security Importance by Area

#### 👤 User Data Protection
Securing personal information is paramount as the platform stores sensitive user details including contact information and location data. Breaches could lead to identity theft or unauthorized account access, damaging user trust and potentially violating data protection regulations.

#### 💳 Payment Security
The payment processing system handles financial transactions between guests and hosts, making it a high-value target. Strong security measures prevent unauthorized transactions, protect banking information, and ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards.

#### 🏘️ Property Listing Integrity
Security measures ensure that only authorized users can create, modify, or delete property listings. This maintains the reliability of the platform and prevents fraudulent listings that could harm the platform's reputation or lead to financial losses for users.

#### 📅 Booking System Security
Protecting the booking system prevents unauthorized modifications to reservations that could result in financial losses, double bookings, or denied service. Security here ensures the reliability of the core business functionality.

#### 🔌 API Endpoint Protection
Securing API endpoints against unauthorized access and attacks prevents data leakage, service disruption, and maintains the overall system integrity. This is especially important for public-facing APIs that may be targeted by automated attacks.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates the process of integrating, testing, and deploying code changes. This approach is crucial for maintaining code quality and enabling rapid, reliable updates to the application.

### Key Benefits for the Project

- **Automated Testing**: Every code change is automatically tested, ensuring that new features don't break existing functionality
- **Consistent Deployments**: Standardized deployment process reduces human error and ensures consistent environments
- **Faster Release Cycles**: Automates manual processes, allowing for more frequent and reliable releases
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are identified early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and time to fix

### Implementation Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation directly integrated with the GitHub repository
- **Docker**: Container-based deployment ensures consistency across development and production environments
- **pytest**: Automated testing framework for Python code
- **flake8/black**: Code linting and formatting to maintain code quality standards
- **Ansible/Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for managing deployment environments

The CI/CD pipeline will automate building, testing, and deploying the Airbnb clone application, creating a streamlined workflow from development to production while maintaining high quality standards.
